# salary_prediction_using_simple_linear_regression

In this program we built a simple linear regression model and trained it to predict the salary of an employee. 
Since this is not a showcase but an implementation of linear regression to predict the salary of an employee with the years of experience as the attribute.
Using of test_train_split can reduce the accuracy of the mode so we decided not to use it. 
This program will take the attribute as input and predict the salary of the employee.
